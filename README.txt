This extension is used to update the contributor badges for Partners, Members
and Sponsors based on the group memberships.
Badge information is stored in the custom data: Service Provider - Badges

Logic:
For Partners, Members, Sponsors
a. Group “Contributors / Supporting Contributors” -> display civibadge-contributor-supporting.png
b. Group “Contributors / Empowering Contributors” -> display civibadge-contributor-empowering.png
c. Group “Contributors / Sustaining Contributors” -> display civibadge-contributor-sustaining.png

Instructions:
Add the contact to a group and the corresponding badge value will be
automatically updated. All the views will display new badge.

Note that “contributor-empowering” is set as default in the current system even
if the contact is not in “Empowering Contributor” group. If you want to remove
that badge, then you will need to manually add that contact to the
“Empowering Contributors” group and then remove them from the group.
